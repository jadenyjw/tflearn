# Building an Image Classifier with TFLearn

##### Introduction
Image classification has been a very fascinating task for computers for a very long time. Whilst a human can easily identify objects in an image, it is difficult for computers to do so. The human brain _automagically_ understands what it is looking at given inputs of vision from the eyes, from what it has learnt from experience. The computer analyzes images from the pixels of the given image by comparing it to what it has seen before.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Prepare images for processing (without preprocessed data)
- Program and train a neural network with the images
- Evaluate and test your model.

##### Architecture
So how can we teach the computer to classify pictures of various objects? The answer is a special type of neural network called a **convolutional neural network**. Many researchers have devised many variations of this neural network, which all differ in hyperparameters such as number of nodes, layers, etc, so there is no set solution for each task.
